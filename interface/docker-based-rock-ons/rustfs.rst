RustFS Rock-on
==============

Before you install the RustFS Rock-on, you should understand the 
prerequisites and configurations common to all Rockstor 
:ref:`rockons_intro`, specifically the :ref:`rockons_preinstall` 
and :ref:`rockons_root` requirements.


.. _rustfs_whatis:

What is RustFS?
---------------

`RustFS <https://rustfs.com>`_ is an open-source, high-performance 
S3-compatible object storage system. 
RustFS can scale from a single server with a single object store 
all the way to a fault-tolerant commercial-grade distributed infrastructure. 
This RustFS Rock-on targets the low end, creating a
single RustFS server using a single Rockstor share as its object store. 
This configuration should be perfect for catching and storing backups on a home 
server, for example.

This RustFS Rock-on does not implement encryption. 
If connections between the client and the RustFS server traverse a network 
lacking physical security, consider either using a VPN or putting RustFS 
behind a reverse proxy for encryption. 
Implementing native encryption in the RustFS Rock-on, although
possible, would require post-installation configuration and on-going
certificate management in addition to the RustFS Rock-on installation. 
This would violate the '"all-in-one" user experience' guideline in
:ref:`contributerockons`.

Once installation is complete you can point your S3-compatible client at
the URL for your server (``http://rockstor-server-address:9001``) and use 
the Access Key and Secret Key that you specified during installation.


.. _rustfs_migration:

Migration from Other S3-compatible Object Stores
------------------------------------------------

If you are switching from another S3-compatible object server 
(MinIO, for example), be aware that there presently is no 
direct migration tool.  Specifically, you cannot simply reuse 
a share full of MinIO objects by specifying it as the share for 
RustFS.  The only migration option for now is to use an S3 
client software package such as `MinIO Client <https://github.com/minio/mc>`_ 
to copy the objects from MinIO to RustFS.


.. _rustfs_documentation:

RustFS Documentation
--------------------
Official documentation for the RustFS project can be found at 
<https://docs.rustfs.com/>.


.. _rustfs_install:

Installing the RustFS Rock-on
-----------------------------
The RustFS Rock-on requires a Rockstor share to use as the object store.
You should create this share in a pool with sufficient space for your needs
before beginning the RustFS Rock-on installation.

The RustFS Docker container runs as user ID (UID) 10001, group ID (GID) 10001.  
Before starting the installation process, create a user with UID 10001 and a 
group with GID 10001, then assign ownership of the RustFS share to that user 
and group.  
See :ref:`users` for details on creating users and groups, and 
:ref:`accesscontrol` for setting share access controls.

Once your share is ready, click the "Install" button next to the RustFS listing
on the Rock-ons page.

.. _rustfs_ports:

RustFS Ports
------------

RustFS needs to know what TCP ports you would like to assign to the 
S3 Application Programming Interface (API) and to the Web management 
interface. The standard ports for S3-compatible servers are 9000 (API) 
and 9001 (Web UI).  Specify those standard ports unless you have an 
application that requires non-standard ports, or you have another 
Rock-on already using those ports.

.. _rustfs_environment:

Set the RustFS Environment Variables
------------------------------------
RustFS needs values for three environment variables.  "Access Key" 
(3 to 128 alphanumeric characters), 
"Secret Key" (8 to 128 alphanumeric characters), 
and "RUSTFS_CONSOLE_ENABLE".  
"Access Key" and "Secret Key" are the username and password you 
will use on the Web management interface and in your S3-compatible 
client software.
"RUSTFS_CONSOLE_ENABLE" should be set to "true" unless 
you have some reason for disabling the Web management interface.

.. _rustfs_console:

RustFS Web Console Interface
----------------------------
You can open a Web browser and navigate to 
`http://rockstor-server-address:9001` to go to the RustFS Web management interface.  
There you can view and create storage objects.  
Point your S3-compatible application at your new server and you are 
up and running with RustFS block storage.
